# lnmb — Leave No Medic Behind

The Leave No Medic Behind (LNMB) Initiative supports underprivileged medical students through fundraising and community events.

## 2025

The Leave No Medic Behind Initiative Charity Run is a fundraising project by the Association of Medical Students of the University of Nairobi (AMSUN) to meet the financial needs of underprivileged students in the School of Medicine.

It began in 2017 when the then 5th year MBChB Class had a classmate who was almost denied to sit for their end of year exams because of a fees balance of less than sh 20,000. His classmates rallied together, each giving what they could and with that the student was able to sit for his exams and hence LNMB was born.

From 2017 to 2021, LNMB has primarily done student-centered funds drive using the harambee model however in 2022 there emerged the idea to organise for a charity run.

The project is being run in conjunction with the AMSUN Running Club — a registered club of runners in the School of Medicine. The project involves raising funds from sponsors and well-wishers plus the sale of T-shirts to participants who will take part in the run.

## About this repo

This repository contains the LNMB website built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript and related frontend tooling. The project was bootstrapped with a Next.js starter and includes a `convex/` folder for backend bindings.

If you are looking for the original Node/Express/Mongo implementation described in older LNMB documentation, that is a separate project — this repo focuses on the current Next.js frontend.

## The Tech Stack (current)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) — React framework for production
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Convex](https://convex.dev) — backend (present in `convex/`)
- CSS with PostCSS

For the legacy backend (Node/Express/MongoDB) used historically by the initiative, see the original project notes (not included here).
