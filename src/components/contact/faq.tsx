              This is a fundraising initiative started in 2017 with the aim of
              raising funds for school fees, accommodation and food for
              underprivileged medical students. In 2022, the idea was developed
              for a charity run to be organized to boost the funds drive.

              We wouldn&apos;t advise you to wear last year&apos;s t-shirt to
              this year&apos;s run because the 2024 design will be fresh and new
              and you may prefer to buy the new t-shirt. Furthermore, t-shirt
              sales are the main source of income for the fund &mdash; buying a
              new t-shirt supports a needy medical student.

              The Leave No Medic Behind initiative fund is housed by Kenya
              Medical Association (KMA) Nairobi Division where it is legally
              recognized as the Prof Hassan Saidi Education Memorial Fund. The
              bank account is managed by KMA whereby there are 3 signatories to
              the account who are all doctors. No medical student is a signatory
              to the account and none will ever be. A minimum of 2 signatories
              (of the 3 doctors who oversee) are required to sign before any
              funds are withdrawn from the account. All financial records and
              documents are carefully kept by KMA. The beneficiaries of the LNMB
              fund are vetted thoroughly before being admitted to the program
              and furthermore, funds for their school fees are disbursed
              directly to the University fees collection bank account while
              funds for food and accommodation are also disbursed directly to
              the University Mess and Hostels Of Residence bank accounts
              respectively.
